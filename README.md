## 🧠 How It Works

- The game lights up a random sequence of colored buttons.
- The user must remember and replicate the sequence by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
- With each level, the sequence grows longer, increasing the difficulty.
- If the player clicks the wrong button, the game ends and restarts.
